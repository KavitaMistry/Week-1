# We Are All Digital Now: Digital Photography and the Reshaping of Historical Practice
[We Are All Digital Now: Digital Photography and the Reshaping of Historical Practice](https://muse-jhu-edu.proxy.library.carleton.ca/article/777493/pdf)

This article was such an important read. It highlights the shift from sitting in the archives and transcribing notes for hours to finding a source, taking an image and referring to it later. While there are advantages and disadvantages to the latter, my argument still stands that while we live in an era where efficiency is valued over accuracy, in some cases, like archival work, efficiency is not always the best practice. Although Ian had highlighted specific statistics after conducting a survey, there were positive responses with people saying "going digital is the best" and then there were others who did not agree. In my perspective, I concur with those who disagreed as time and money also become an issue. Taking pictures of a document you think is helpful only to come home and realize it wasn't what you thought it was, or the images came out blurry, were cut off or missed specific pages means have to spend more time and more money going back. Something that was supposed to save you time, now becomes more time consuming. I do however agree that having an archive run online digital portal with images of archival documents should be implemented where people can create their own private libraries of documents that will help them with research. Why have 1000 people take photos of the same thing, when the institution can take the photo and share it with 1000 people? Going digital also means that we can access archival documents around the world which helps to expand out range of knowledge, as well our arguments as we can incorporate more than one view of the subject from different eras of the world.

>Information was processed as it came in: arguments were formed, new lines of inquiry were opened, and all with an understanding of profound time scarcity.

In another article by Bonnie Smith on seminars and archival research, sometimes archival research had limitations and only certain people could access certain things. That has and has not changed today. We can access information and documents online, and in the archive, but we must request special access, or book appointments in order to access archives when it is convenient for the archive.

>The speed by which we can now process this in-formation means that pivotal decisions – what information will be brought home to view through our monitors – are made when we have the least information

This is a problematic but true statement. Today, we value efficiency over accuracy in many things we do. Sometimes we miss the bigger picture of quickly accessing a document and looking at it at home. What if there is another document that is recommended within the one you are already reading, you would have to go back to the archive and find it, wasting more time that if you studying in the archive with all resources available.

>There are biases in these responses, some owing to the selection method and some related to who may have answered versus who may have not

This is an interesting point as it shows generational biases as well in archival research and the study of history. Not to say Professors are old, but there is a difference between the way they were taught and how they studied history versus now, and what tools were not available back then are available now. Having some people respond and others not respond or able to participate in this survey based on their level of education within the profession of History creates discrepancies in the diversity of the answers.

>although the prospect of limiting one’s research to what they had taken photographs of strikes me as a narrowing of the opportunities open to historians

Huge problem! Many times historians miss the bigger picture by limiting themselves to certain documents! This then either forces them to broaden their horizon with multiple trips or they "deal with it", which then hinders not only their understanding of a historical subject, but the readers their articles will be intended for.

>The alternative would be to get home from the archives with no idea what I’ve found, and then have to look through thousands of photos to get anywhere.”

It's like doing double the amount of work. At this point technology as an efficient aid is not so efficient after all.

>Much of the labour of digitizing documents is not the actual scanning of the document but, rather, the description and metadata that makes that document findable and usable for others

Another issue I see with this method is taking a picture of a document and not being able to properly source it because they did not take a picture of the citation information.
