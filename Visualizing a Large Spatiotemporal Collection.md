# Visualizing a Large Spatiotemporal Collection of Historic Photographywith a Generous Interface
[Visualizing a Large Spatiotemporal Collection of Historic Photography with a Generous Interface](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.02242.pdf)

A key issue in many museums and cultural heritage institutions is accessibility of their collections, but not only allowing the public to access it, but how to engage them in the content. In this article, Arnold and Ayers argue for the use of a generous interface, defined by a “shift from singular narrow interaction of the keyword search, such as a google search, to interfaces that communicate the scale, scope and richness of a collection”. This allows the user to interact with content in a variety of ways through geographical regions with a colour coded map, specific photographers and a timeline of their photographs and common content and subject matter. Arnold and Ayers, along with a team of experts created a web-based platform called Photogrammer originally launched in 2014, and revamped up until 2020, that visualizes the 170,000 images from the Farm Security Administration and Office of War Information (FSA-OWI) photographic archives. This article examines the changes made to the original site and what new features are offered to enhance the visitor experience and engagement. They have added things like recommendations under each photograph that allow the user to explore other parts of the collection and break free from their own comfort zone. They found in the original launch that people would often click on the region they are from and only explore that, so by adding in a recommendation at the bottom, they are guiding the user to other like images of different areas. As stated in the article, “generous interfaces therefore provide a theoretical and methodological frame for designing systems that disrupt classifications of data and metadata in the way that humanistic inquiry often demands”. However, in my view, adding in a recommendations or content filter perhaps limits the users ability to interact with the whole content as they are persuaded to follow a guided and structured path based on what they are already looking at, but this is an argument for another time. Regardless of my differing opinion, this research is incredibly relevant for creating accessible platforms for collections of museum and cultural heritage institutions as, especially in a pandemic word, people want to be able to access a site virtually and have access to something more freely in their own space and time.

A big yes! Studies have definitely proven, (my own little class experiment included) that people learn better when more than one sense is engaged, and when there are multiple dimensions involved in the exploration!

_drop images, screenshots as relevant into the vault, link to them here. Use backticks to copy in relevant code snippets etc_

```
# example R code
data <- read.csv("data")
```

## challenges 

_error messages, unclear instructions, gaps in my knowledge, links to relevant asks for help on discord, stackoverflow posts, websites I went to for help_

## thoughts on where to go next

_what can I do? who can I talk to? links to posts in discord, helpf fora, etc. links to other research projects etc_
