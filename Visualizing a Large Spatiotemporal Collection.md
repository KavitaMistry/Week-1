# Visualizing a Large Spatiotemporal Collection of Historic Photographywith a Generous Interface
[Visualizing a Large Spatiotemporal Collection of Historic Photography with a Generous Interface](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.02242.pdf)

A key issue in many museums and cultural heritage institutions is accessibility of their collections, but not only allowing the public to access it, but how to engage them in the content. In this article, Arnold and Ayers argue for the use of a generous interface, defined by a “shift from singular narrow interaction of the keyword search, such as a google search, to interfaces that communicate the scale, scope and richness of a collection”. This allows the user to interact with content in a variety of ways through geographical regions with a colour coded map, specific photographers and a timeline of their photographs and common content and subject matter. Arnold and Ayers, along with a team of experts created a web-based platform called Photogrammer originally launched in 2014, and revamped up until 2020, that visualizes the 170,000 images from the Farm Security Administration and Office of War Information (FSA-OWI) photographic archives. This article examines the changes made to the original site and what new features are offered to enhance the visitor experience and engagement. They have added things like recommendations under each photograph that allow the user to explore other parts of the collection and break free from their own comfort zone. They found in the original launch that people would often click on the region they are from and only explore that, so by adding in a recommendation at the bottom, they are guiding the user to other like images of different areas. As stated in the article, “generous interfaces therefore provide a theoretical and methodological frame for designing systems that disrupt classifications of data and metadata in the way that humanistic inquiry often demands”. However, in my view, adding in a recommendations or content filter perhaps limits the users ability to interact with the whole content as they are persuaded to follow a guided and structured path based on what they are already looking at, but this is an argument for another time. Regardless of my differing opinion, this research is incredibly relevant for creating accessible platforms for collections of museum and cultural heritage institutions as, especially in a pandemic word, people want to be able to access a site virtually and have access to something more freely in their own space and time.

A big yes! Studies have definitely proven, (my own little class experiment included) that people learn better when more than one sense is engaged, and when there are multiple dimensions involved in the exploration!

The Smithsonian has this really cool project where they are creating 3D digitized models of items in their collection, hopefully all (but that could take years) but it is intended to be interactive in the sense that people are able to access the collection, able to manipulate the 3D model with 360 degree control and also download the file so that they can 3D print the object for themselves. Not only is this project intended to make the collection available to the public but it is used by conservators to track changes to the artifacts if they are damaged/deteriorating. Super neat!

Are there copyright laws associated with this data?

So I understand the use of generous interfaces, however, I question it a little. I think about how, when we click on a retail site for all our online shopping needs, it pops up on our FaceBook pages as a "recommended page" as if to say "we know you are shopping at this place, check out what else they have in this category". While this generous interface is creating an interactive approach to the collection, I fear the statement "metadata shifts based on the community and their interests" will hinder the user from exploration of the entire collection, and rather takes them on a specific and catered journey based on what they click. Thoughts?

>While the neural network usedis trained entirely on color images, the implicit connections createdby the embedding produce surprisingly consistent and meaningfulresults on the predominantly black-and-white images in the FSA-OWI collection [29].

I am curious how different the results would be if the original images were not black and white. How does the fact that an image has colour affect the matching of data within the system?
