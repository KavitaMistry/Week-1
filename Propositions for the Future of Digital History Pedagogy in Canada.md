# Clio, Rewired: Propositions for the Future of Digital History Pedagogy in Canada
[Clio, Rewired: Propositions for the Future of Digital History Pedagogy in Canada].(https://muse-jhu-edu.proxy.library.carleton.ca/article/777494/pdf)

As a woman in Digital History, this article really hit home. It is very true that women, people of colour and the LGBTQ2+ communities are not well represented in the classroom, in texts and in the overall study of digital history. In a reading I did for another class, we looked at the origin of seminars and of archival research, and how it was a male dominated practice and was considered a profession that makes a man, a man. It feels as though we are following that same pattern, not as harshly, but where women are once again disregarded more in a specific practice that is dominated by men. Slowly but surely we are changing that with more women contributing and pursuing academics and careers in digital history. Kimberley makes a very strong point that in order for us to learn about women/ the LGBTQ2+ community in this field is to start talking about it, and start incorporating their works into teachings and other articles. I do like Kimberleys breakdown of each section focusing on a problem and looking at ways to be more inclusive by giving examples of projects that people can explore to pique their interests. But she is correct, it starts with conversation and the idea of "spread the word"!

>as there were so few women and people of col-our represented in its pages.

Yes, yes and yes! I am by no means an expert in digital humanities, however throughout my MA research, the majority of papers that I found were written by men. The majority of studies done and experiments held were done by men. And in the case of a woman writing an article, sometimes it would be disregarded in other articles, written by men. It is only in the recent era where we are starting to see women contributing in these fields, simply because we are able to get educations that allow us to add to the understanding of things.

>“Why are there so few women in the history of digital history?

An interesting book to read is called New Digital Worlds: Postcolonial Digital Humanities in Theory, Praxis and Pedagogy by Roopika Risam! She does wonders with highlighting the use of digital humanities in the post colonial world as well raises issues and questions on the exclusion of race, gender, sex, disability and nation in present day digital humanities!

>ArQuives, Canada’s lgbtq2+ Archives

I will be honest, I did not learn about the ArQuives until last year. It is not something that is widely shared in the classroom or in other scholarly articles. I think it is very important to spread word about this archive and the work of the LGBTQ2+ community as their contributions to history and digital history is just as important than our own.

>For women in digital history, these forms of public engagement encourage us to take up space, and to inhabit the scholarly arenas

This is an important point. In an article by Bonnie Smith on Seminars and Archival Research, the field was dominated by men, and it was considered a manly profession. Women who attempted to contribute to seminars and archival research were put down because of the things they chose to focus on, for example, women were seen to focus on unnecessary everyday objects, where men focused on wide scope theories. But, with the emergence of women in academia we are finally able to contribute our opinions without others saying it is valueless. But it starts with conversation and educating others on these matters. Like she said, we need to start talking about women in DH.
